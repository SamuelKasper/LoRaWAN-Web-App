# This project was implemented as a part of my bachelor thesis.
>The goal was to implement a prototype of an intelligent irrigation system based on LoRaWAN.

## Implementation
### Frontend
>The Frontend was implemented with Embedded JavaScript (EJS) and Bootstrap.

### Backend
>The Backend was implemented with Node.js, Express.js and TypeScript.

### DB and Web Host
>As database, MongoDB was used and the Web Host is Render.com.
>The webapp also uses The Things Network.

### Hardware
>The webapp reads the names of the user data and therefore only works with specific sensors. Following hardware should be used:
>- Distance sensor: Milesight EM310-UDL (868MHz)
>- Soil moisture sensor: Dragino LSE01 (868MHz)
>- As hardware controlling unit, the Seeeduino LoRaWAN was used.

## Result
>The webapp can be seen here: https://lorawan-web-app.onrender.com/ <br>
>Due TTN restrictions, the ability to send downlinks is deactivated for anyone except of myself.
